# S2 Instant Messenger

This features an MVVM Based WPF IM Client w/Server. As a whole, this is just the start and will require a lot of work if it should be finished. But as is I would say it's a very basic version or a start in the Messenger world. It has a big feature list for the future if the development will continue, some examples could be: Login w/Password & Hashing for security, Database storage, Chat Server Rooms, etc.

Development Time: Roughly **4** days.
